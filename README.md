# bin
A collection of BASH scripts I wrote to make my life easier

| image_sizes | shows the width and height of images | 
| lcase_files | no warning, renames all files in your current directory to lowercase. -f flag passed to rename to make it work on windows subsystem for linux |
| remove_prefix | to remove prefixes in filenames.  eg.  sa_human_01.obj, sa_human_02.obj, remove_prefix sa_ will rename to human_01.obj and human_02.obj |
| resize_for_tts | resizes images to be aligned in a grid, adding padding where needed |
